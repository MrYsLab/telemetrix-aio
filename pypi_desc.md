# The Telemetrix Project

The Telemetrix Project is a modern-day replacement for 
Arduino StandardFirmata, equipped with many more built-in features than 
StandardFirmata. 

Here is a feature comparison between Telemetrix and StandardFirmata:

The project consists of a 
[Python client API](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/telemetrix-aio/blob/master/html/telemetrix_aio/index.html)
used to create a Python 
client 
application and C++ servers that communicate with the Python client over a serial or WiFi link. 

This repository is the Python 3 asyncio client API.

The server for Arduino serial linked devices is called
[Telemetrix4Arduino](https://github.com/MrYsLab/Telemetrix4Arduino).

The WiFi server for ESP8266 devices is called
[Telemetrix4Esp8266](https://github.com/MrYsLab/Telemetrix4Esp8266).

A [User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/telemetrix/) explaining installation and use is available online.
